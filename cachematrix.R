# Well, this functions do a lot of different things for a living.
# One of them even worked in a circus!!!

# This beautiful and extremely useful function (meant to revolutionise humanity as a whole)
# Will be the root from wich the Future AI will evolve!!
# The first one creates a matrix with random numbers in it and transpose it for no good reason
#  it later cuts of some stuff to square it to 10x10

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  # takes the matrix and 
  # Creates an empty matrix
  m0 <<- matrix(,nrow=0, ncol=0)
  
  
  
  # Transpose it back and forth just for the sake of it
  x <- t(x)
  x <- t(x)
  # Very important fnctionality of htis program!!!
  #print("Calling my buddy Pete for help. BRB...\n")
  #Sys.sleep(120)
  # Test reversibility: 
  if (length(x[,1]!=length(x[1,])) {
    print("This Matrix-thingy is non-reversible you d******k !!\nGo make a new one!!!")
  } else {
    m0 <<- solve(x)
  }
    
}


# This function is a clear demonstration of my advanced codign zk1llz: It takes the matrix from above
# and reverses the heck out of it, once this is done it hacks your computer and sends me the password of your 
# WoW account!

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        #This part is the most difficult one as it requires 
  # a steady pulse and good aim with hte keyboard to write
   if()
        y <<- solve(x)
  #And now to finish it, the matesterly placed Curly Brace of Doom!!
